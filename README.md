# Zombie-modelling
 A repository for my project on modelling Zombies and the spread of infectious diseases

The notebooks are:
* **SketchFile.ipynb**: A sketch notebook for developing workflow

* **GenerateGifs.ipynb**: A notebook to generate visualisations of infection spreading across a country

The repo folders are organised as follows:

* **Data**: Folder containing data, at the moment just geotiff files of population density. Organised by country and year.

* **imgs**: Output images to be used for gif generation

* **movies**: Output gifs made from images in imgs folder

* **streamlit**: Files for the interactive webapp
